# Hi, I'm SHAH ZAIB — aka 5hezy / SH4HZ4IB

I'm a software engineering student at DHA Suffa University with a deep-rooted passion for cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and development. My journey began in 2012–2013, when I explored tools like BackTrack, performed WiFi hacks, HTML phishing, and even worked with SQL vulnerabilities.

I was part of a small ethical hacking group that once warned an Israeli motorbike website through a controlled breach — all for awareness. I used to run a tech blog [sh4hz4ib.blogspot.com](https://sh4hz4ib.blogspot.com) where I shared tutorials on antivirus tools and online security.
